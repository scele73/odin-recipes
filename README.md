# odin-recipes

Hello friends!

I have just finished some of the first lessons in The Odin Project, and as such I will now
be doing a project to make sure I understand what it is I've learned and how to use it. 

The project will be a simple recipe website, where I will use github skills, along with some basic html concepts.
